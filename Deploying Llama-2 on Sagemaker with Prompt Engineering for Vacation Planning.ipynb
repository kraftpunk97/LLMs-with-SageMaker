      "To begin with, how about trying some relaxation activities? There are so many options to choose from, but here are a few that might be helpful:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Yoga or meditation: These practices can help you relax your body and mind, and can even improve your mental clarity. Many resorts and spas offer yoga and meditation classes, or you could try following along with a video at home.\n",
      "2. Beach time: Spending time by the ocean can be incredibly calming and relaxing. You could try taking a leisurely walk along the beach, reading a book, or simply sitting and soaking up the sun.\n",
      "3. Spa treatments: Treating yourself to a massage or other spa treatment can be a great way to relax and unwind. Many spas also offer facials, body wraps, and other treatments that can help you feel more relaxed and refreshed.\n",
      "4. Nature walks: Taking a walk in a beautiful natural setting can be a great way to clear your mind and feel more relaxed. You could try walking through a park, forest, or along a river.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's incorporate some elements that can help with mental clarity as well. Here are a few ideas:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Creative activities: Engaging in creative activities like painting, writing, or playing music can help you clear your mind and gain mental clarity. Many resorts and retreats offer classes or workshops in these areas, or you could try doing them on your own with a kit or online resources.\n",
      "2. Mindfulness exercises: Practicing mindfulness exercises, such as focusing on your breath or paying attention to your surroundings, can help you cultivate mental clarity. You could try incorporating these exercises into your daily routine, or you could take a class or workshop to learn more.\n",
      "3. Journaling: Writing in a journal can be a great way to process your thoughts and feelings, and can help you gain mental clarity. You could try writing each day, or setting\n"

Find a nearby park or forest and take a leisurely walk, or even better, a guided forest bathing tour.\n",

      "3. Sound Healing: Sound healing is a form of therapy that uses sound vibrations to promote healing and balance in the body. You can find sound healing sessions at local wellness centers or spas, or even try it out on your own by using a sound bowl or singing bowl.\n",
      "4. Aromatherapy: Certain scents have been shown to have a calming effect on the mind and body. Try using essential oils in a diffuser or applying them to your skin during a massage. Some calming scents include lavender, chamomile, and bergamot.\n",
      "5. Meditation and Mindfulness: Meditation and mindfulness practices can help you focus your attention and calm your mind. You can find guided meditations at local studios or online, or try practicing on your own using a meditation app.\n",

    "We will see the various approaches used in Prompt Engineering and compare the output for each of them. We try different payloads for ART, Self Consistency and RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameters specified in the Llama-2 payload control the behavior of the model's text generation process. Each parameter influences how the output is generated, offering a way to customize the results according to specific needs. Here's a detailed explanation of each parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`do_sample`**: This parameter determines whether the model should generate text by sampling from the distribution of possible next tokens (when set to `True`) or by always choosing the most likely next token (when set to `False`). Sampling can introduce variability and creativity in the responses, making the text more diverse and less deterministic.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`top_p`** (also known as nucleus sampling): This is a threshold parameter used to control the diversity of the generated text. It specifies a cumulative probability cutoff to select a subset of the vocabulary tokens for sampling. For example, if `top_p` is set to 0.6, the model will only consider the smallest set of tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds 60% for sampling. This helps in focusing the sampling process on more likely tokens while still allowing for some creativity and variation in the responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`temperature`**: This parameter controls the randomness of the output generation. A higher temperature results in more random outputs, while a lower temperature makes the model's outputs more deterministic and conservative. For instance, a temperature of 0.8 moderates the balance between randomness and determinism, aiming to produce outputs that are neither too random nor too predictable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`top_k`**: This parameter limits the number of highest probability vocabulary tokens to consider for each step in the text generation process. Only the top `k` tokens are considered for sampling, which helps to filter out less likely tokens and can prevent the model from generating implausible text. A value of 50 means that only the top 50 tokens according to their probability will be considered at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **`max_new_tokens`**: This specifies the maximum number of new tokens to be generated by the model. In this context, a token can be a word or part of a word, so this parameter effectively controls the maximum length of the generated text. Setting it to 512 limits the output to 512 tokens, which helps in managing the output size and ensuring responses are not overly long.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **`repetition_penalty`**: This parameter is used to discourage the model from repeating the same words or phrases. A penalty greater than 1.0 decreases the likelihood of tokens that have already appeared in the output, encouraging the model to generate more diverse and less repetitive text. A value of 1.03 applies a slight penalty to repetitions, aiming to maintain a balance between coherence and repetition avoidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these parameters offer a nuanced control over the text generation process, allowing users to fine-tune the model's behavior to match specific requirements for creativity, diversity, length, and coherence of the generated text."
